# Serverless TypeScript VSCode Starter

An opinionated boilerplate for getting up and running using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
and [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/).

## Quick Start

Install dependencies and start to get an emulated API Gateway
running locally by running the following in your terminal:

```sh
npm install && npm start
```

Any changes made to your handler code while this is running will
automatically be detected and restart your local API Gateway
with the new changes live.
